Hi Justin, 

Any interest in moving to San Francisco?

I saw your GoogleNewsDownloader project and want to fly you out here.

A few of us founders have banded together to find talented engineers across the US and, if they're inclined, help them move out here. We're hoping you're one of those engineers.

We include a couple YCombinator companies, and all of us are small (2 - 20 engineers), well-funded, extremely technical companies.

If you're interested, let me know and we'll chat about what you're looking for, and see if we can find you a good fit.

Cheers,
Justin Wilcox
