Hi Justin, 

Any interest in moving to San Francisco?

I saw your GoogleNewsDownloader project and want to get you out here.

A few of us founders have banded together to find talented engineers and, if they're inclined, help them move out here. We're hoping you're one of those engineers.

We include a couple YCombinator companies, and all of us are small (2 - 20 engineers), well-funded, extremely technical companies.

If you're interested, happy to chat about what you're looking for and see if we can find a good fit.
